# Architecture

## Seven Entry Points (Program.cs)

| Command | Class | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `imrdy hook` | HookCommand | Fast-path: read stdin JSON, derive status, write state file. No WinForms. Lightweight DI via HookServiceBuilder. |
| `imrdy <cmd>` | CommandRouter | CLI commands (status, packs, config, workspace, links, stop, inspect-live, render-live). Spectre.Console output. |
| `imrdy preview-dashboard <fixture>` | PreviewDashboardCommand | Standalone WinForms dev tool; inline ServiceCollection, bypasses mutex, runs SessionDashboardForm pinned from fixture JSON. |
| `imrdy render <component> [args]` | RenderCommand | In-process PNG capture of WinForms surfaces; bypasses mutex; sequential STA execution. See [Render Verb Architecture](render-verb-architecture.md). |
| `imrdy inspect-live <id>` | InspectLiveCommand | Thin CLI client: connects to tray via `Local\ImrdyInspect` pipe, emits walker+analyzer JSON. |
| `imrdy render-live <id> --output F` | RenderLiveCommand | Thin CLI client: connects to tray via `Local\ImrdyInspect` pipe, captures live SessionDashboardForm PNG. |
| `imrdy` | TrayApp | WinForms ApplicationContext. Application.Run with message pump. Full DI via MonitorServiceBuilder. |

The hook runs hundreds of times per session. It must be fast (~50ms). No COM, no WinForms initialization. The `inspect-live` and `render-live` commands are thin clients — all heavy work (walking, rendering) runs inside the already-running tray on the UI thread via `BeginInvoke` + `TaskCompletionSource` bridge. See [Tray IPC](inspect-ipc.md) for protocol details.

**A CLI verb needs two touches in `Program.cs`, not one.** `CommandRouter`'s `switch` is the second; the first is the `args[0] is "status" or "packs" or ... ` pattern that decides whether to take the Spectre branch at all. A verb wired only into `CommandRouter` falls through to the tray fallback and *silently starts a tray* — it prints nothing and exits 0, which does not look like a routing bug. `imrdy links` shipped that way for one build.

## The Linux Binary (src/Imrdy.Linux/Program.cs)

A separate binary with its own, much smaller arm set:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `imrdy hook` | Same fast path. `LinuxHookEnvironment.EnsureTrayRunning` probes `DaemonLock.IsRunning` and spawns the daemon via `sh -c '... &'` (stdio to `/dev/null`, orphaned to init) only when at least one enabled link exists. Every failure swallowed. |
| `imrdy daemon` | `DaemonCommand` → `DaemonHost`. The event loop Linux has no `Application.Run` analogue for. SIGINT and SIGTERM are intercepted by a `PosixSignalRegistration` pair in `RunDaemon` whose handler sets `ctx.Cancel = true` and cancels the token, so both unwind `Main` and release the lock and PID file through `Dispose`. `Console.CancelKeyPress` was measured not to dispatch on Linux and is not used. Signals outside that pair (SIGHUP, SIGQUIT) still terminate without unwinding: the kernel drops the `daemon.lock` flock and `daemon.pid` stays behind naming a dead pid — benign, since liveness is read from the lock. `ProcessExit` stays subscribed as the only cancellation signal on those paths, and `RunDaemon` unsubscribes it in a `finally` because the runtime raises it after the `using` has disposed the source it captures; the two registrations need no unsubscribe, being `using var`s declared after the source so they dispose first. Returns an exit code rather than calling `Environment.Exit`. |
| `imrdy links [--json]` | Plain stdout via `LinksReport.RenderLines` — no Spectre. |

## State File Lifecycle

1. Hook writes `~/.imrdy/sessions/{session_id}.json` with a direct in-place write, not a temp-file rename (see [State File Write Path](state-file-write-path.md))
2. TrayApp's FileSystemWatcher detects change
3. Debounce timer (100ms drain) batches rapid changes
4. `HandleSessionFileChanged` reads state, updates icon/menu/overlay
5. Dwell timer gates toast/sound notifications (see [Notification Dwell](notification-dwell.md))

## Field Preservation

`FieldPreservation.PreserveFields()` carries sticky fields across state file writes. The hook writes a new state file on every event, but some fields are tray-owned (sound pack, desktop, icon style) or must survive events that do not carry them (start time, WSL distro, the running-work roster). The merge is `newState.Field ?? existing.Field` — new value wins if set, otherwise keep existing.

That list is the **symmetry contract** between hook writes and tray writes — any tray-owned field NOT on it is silently dropped by the next hook event. See [Field Preservation Catalog](field-preservation-catalog.md) for the fields, why each is preserved, why `RunningTasks` distinguishes `null` from `[]`, and the audit procedure; [Tray vs Hook Write Race](tray-hook-write-race.md) for the race window; [State File Write Path](state-file-write-path.md) for why the file is non-atomic; and [Tray Persistence Verbs](tray-persistence-verbs.md) for the full tray-side write surface. `HookCommand.ClearsRoster` is the write-side counterpart that substitutes `[]` for an absent roster on `Stop` and on `SessionStart` with `source` `startup`/`resume` — see [Teammate Detection](teammate-detection.md).

## Timer Interactions

TrayApp has multiple timers that interact:

| Timer | Interval | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Drain timer | 100ms | Process pending file changes, effective-status resolution, dwell dispatch |
| Sweep timer | 10s | Existence-check only via `CleanupGoneSessions`; removes in-memory entries whose state files are gone |
| Stale timer | 60s | Remove sessions past grace period |

The drain timer is the central coordination point:
1. Process queued file change events
2. Recompute `DisplayStatus.Resolve` per session and diff against `SessionEntry.LastEffectiveStatus` — the sole dwell driver for status changes, including the teal → green flip. `Resolve` is time-independent: it reads the stored roster, so this loop fires on genuine state changes rather than on the passage of time (see [Teammate Detection](teammate-detection.md), [Status Mapping](status-mapping.md))
3. Dispatch fired dwell notifications

The sweep timer is **existence-check only** since commit 4702e86: it runs `CleanupGoneSessions`, which iterates the in-memory session entries and removes any whose state file no longer exists on disk. It does NOT re-read state file contents. FSW (FileSystemWatcher) is the sole real-time path for content changes — the drain timer drains queued FSW events on the 100ms tick. State file bootstrapping at startup is handled separately by `BootstrapSessions`, a one-time scan that runs before the timers start. `SessionEntry.LastProcessedTimestamp` is used in the FSW path: `HandleSessionFileChanged` returns early when the file's `Timestamp` matches `LastProcessedTimestamp`.

## Session Icon Style Resolution

Chain: session override → workspace override (Cwd match) → global config

`ResolveSessionIconStyle()` implements this fallback. Renderer cache is keyed by style name. Changing a workspace's style refreshes all matching session icons.

## Single Instance

Mutex-gated via `Global\ImrdyMonitor`. Hook fast-path probes mutex to decide whether to spawn tray. `TraySpawner.EnsureRunning()` called from hook on every event.

## Stop Signal

Named `EventWaitHandle` (`Local\ImrdyStop`). `imrdy stop` signals it. Tray listens on background thread, marshals `ExitThread` to UI thread.

## Diagnostics IPC Server

Named pipe `Local\ImrdyInspect`. Controlled by `DiagnosticsConfig.IpcEnabled` (`bool?`); default null = on when `~/.imrdy/.dev-build` exists, off otherwise. `InspectIpcServer` in `src/Imrdy.Windows/Diagnostics/` starts 4 parallel accept loops; each request dispatches to the UI thread via `BeginInvoke` + `TaskCompletionSource` with a 2-second budget. See [Tray IPC](inspect-ipc.md) for full protocol details.

# Tray IPC: the render-live, inspect-live and links-live verbs

## Pipe name and protocol

Pipe name: `Local\ImrdyInspect` (constant `ImrdyPaths.InspectPipeName`).

Framing: 4-byte **little-endian length prefix** followed by a UTF-8 JSON body, used in both directions (request → server, response → client).

- **Request**: `InspectRequest(Verb, SessionId, OutputPath?)` — `OutputPath` is null for `inspect-live`, required absolute path for `render-live`. `links-live` needs neither and sends an empty `SessionId`.
- **Response**: `InspectResponse(SchemaVersion, Verb, Error?, Render?, Inspect?, Links?)` — exactly one of `Render`, `Inspect` or `Links` is non-null on success; all are null on error.

### links-live

The third verb exists so `imrdy links` can report **live** link health rather than only the
records in `publishers.json` (ruling r-2). It is session-independent: the handler returns the tray's own
assembled `ConnectionsViewModel` — the same object the connections window renders ([Connections Surfaces](connections-surfaces.md)) — so the CLI and
the window cannot disagree, and no second payload type was needed (`ConnectionsViewModel` was already
registered in `ImrdyJsonContext` for the window).

This is why the pipe matters outside diagnostics: `imrdy links` exits 1 on a `Failed` link only when
it got live health here, and falls back to records-only with exit 0 when no tray answers. Since the
pipe is off by default in production, records-only is the normal path on a shipped install — every
run says which of the two it did. `Imrdy.Linux` has no path to this pipe and is always records-only.

All types are source-generated via `ImrdyJsonContext` (camelCase property naming policy). No reflection.

## Request/response framing (4-byte LE length prefix)

```
[4 bytes: body length, little-endian uint32]
[N bytes: UTF-8 JSON body]
```

Both client and server read the length prefix first, then allocate an exact-size buffer and read exactly N bytes. `BinaryPrimitives.ReadInt32LittleEndian` / `WriteInt32LittleEndian` are used (no endian ambiguity). Max request body: 4 KiB. Max response buffer: 256 KiB.

## Dev-default gate

`DiagnosticsConfig.IpcEnabled` (`bool?`) lives in `ImrdyConfig.Diagnostics`.

Resolution rule used by `TrayApp`: `IpcEnabled ?? File.Exists(ImrdyPaths.DevBuildMarker)`

- **null** (default, not in config.json): IPC starts if `~/.imrdy/.dev-build` exists — i.e., auto-on for dev builds, off in production.
- **true**: IPC always starts regardless of marker.
- **false**: IPC never starts.

`EnsureDefaults` does **not** flatten null to false — the three-state semantics are intentional. Callers MUST use the `?? File.Exists(...)` idiom, never assume `IpcEnabled == false` means disabled.

To enable in production, add `"diagnostics": { "ipcEnabled": true }` to `config.json` — `imrdy config set` has no key for it. The config watcher does not start or stop the pipe; `ipcEnabled` is read when the tray starts.

## Schema versioning policy

`schemaVersion` field is `"1"` (string literal, not integer).

- **Additive changes** (new optional fields, new `kind` values in `DiagnosticFinding`) are non-breaking within v1. Agents SHOULD tolerate unknown fields (forward-compatible reads).
- **Breaking changes** (field removal, type change, semantic change) bump to `"2"`. v1 and v2 will be co-served for at least one release cycle.
- Agents SHOULD check `schemaVersion` before processing; treat unknown versions as future schemas and degrade gracefully.

Full JSON shape documented in [`docs/dashboard-inspect-schema.md`](../../../docs/dashboard-inspect-schema.md).

## Walker output shape (inspect-live)

`InspectService` (Windows-side, UI-thread-only) walks the live `SessionDashboardForm`:

- **`form`** (`FormGeometry`): `formX`, `formY`, `formWidth`, `formHeight`, `clientWidth`, `clientHeight`, `regionRadius`. Field names are camelCase of the C# record param names — note `formX`/`formWidth` (not `x`/`width`).
- **`tree`** (`LayoutNode[]`): flat BFS pre-order list. Index 0 is always the form root. Each node carries `type`, `name`, `text` (truncated at 200 chars), bounds (`boundsX/Y/Width/Height`), colors, font, `anchor`, `dock`, `visible`, padding/margin per-edge, `childIndexes` (indexes into the flat list), and `details` (string→string — carries `"row[N]"` computed heights for `TableLayoutPanel` nodes).
- **`diagnostics`** (`DiagnosticFinding[]`): zero or more findings. Each has `kind`, `severity`, `controlPath`, `message`, `details`.
- **`diagnosticTimestamp`**: ISO 8601 UTC string of when analysis ran.

## Analyzer finding categories

`LayoutAnalyzer` (Core-side, pure/stateless) runs four detectors in order:

| Kind | Severity | Trigger | Details keys |
|---|---|---|---|
| `regionClipRisk` | `warning` (no text) / `error` (has text) | Control bounds intersect a rounded-corner box (radius = `form.regionRadius`) | `corner`, `clippedPixels` |
| `siblingOverlap` | `warning` | Two sibling controls share overlapping bounds (after allow-list; `accentBar`+`headerPanel` overlap is allowed) | `controlA`, `controlB`, `overlapArea` |
| `edgeProximity` | `info` | Control is within 4 px of the form client edge | `edges` (comma-separated: `left`, `top`, `right`, `bottom`) |
| `collapsedRow` | `info` | A `TableLayoutPanel` row height is `"0"` in the node's `details` map | `rowIndex` |

`controlPath` is a slash-separated path from form root to the affected control, e.g. `SessionDashboardForm/TableLayoutPanel[mainLayout]/Panel[sparklinePanel]`. Each segment is `Type` or `Type[Name]` (name omitted when empty).

## Threading model

```
CLI process                   Named pipe                Tray UI thread
───────────────               ──────────────────────    ──────────────────────
RenderLiveCommand.Run()  ──→  InspectIpcServer          
  InspectIpcClient               accept loop task       
    OpenPipeAsync()        ←─   WaitForConnectionAsync  
    SendRequestAsync()     ──→  HandleConnectionAsync   
                                  BeginInvoke ─────────→ handler(req)
                                  TCS.Task.WaitAsync(2s) ←── TCS.SetResult()
    ReadResponseAsync()    ←─   WriteResponseAsync
```

- **4 parallel accept loops** on thread-pool threads — each creates a fresh `NamedPipeServerStream` per accepted connection.
- **UI-thread dispatch**: `_uiControl.BeginInvoke(new Action(...))` + `TaskCompletionSource<InspectResponse>` bridge. Handler has a 2-second budget; `TimeoutException` returns an error response.
- **Client** (`InspectIpcClient`): connects, writes length-prefixed request, reads length-prefixed response, disconnects. No persistent connection.

## Pipe ACL (current-user FullControl)

`PipeSecurity` is built at server start:

```csharp
var ps = new PipeSecurity();
var sid = WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent().User!;
ps.AddAccessRule(new PipeAccessRule(sid, PipeAccessRights.FullControl, AccessControlType.Allow));
```

Only the current user's SID gets `FullControl`. Other accounts cannot connect. ACL build failure logs a warning and skips server start rather than crashing the tray.

A consumer of `inspect-live` identifies a finding by `controlPath` (there is no `nodeIndex`), must handle `"info"` severity, and reads `FormGeometry` by its `formX`/`formWidth` names rather than `x`/`width`.

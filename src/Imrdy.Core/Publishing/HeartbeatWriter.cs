/// inside the beat and the <c>origin_machine</c> the sinks stamp must come from one source, or a
/// publisher reads as two
/// machines with one of them permanently stale. The daemon hands both this and
/// <see cref="SinkContext"/> the same value resolved once at startup, so today a rename needs a
/// daemon restart to take effect on either — the delegate keeps them tied together, it does not

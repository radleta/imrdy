/// dropping <em>is</em> the signal, which is why <c>WireListener</c> can flip a publisher to
/// <see cref="SinkState.Failed"/> and why D20's disconnected treatment works on that path. A
/// file-sink publisher opens no connection, so the receiver had nothing to observe and a
/// terminated WSL distro rendered exactly like a merely-quiet one. This gives the file sink
/// what TCP gets from its transport: an explicit positive signal, written on a fixed interval
/// by the exact process whose liveness is being measured.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>It is not inference from silence.</b> The mechanism <c>agent-liveness-roster</c> deleted
/// read liveness out of the <em>absence</em> of unrelated events, so a quiet-but-working
/// session looked gone. The beat here is written unconditionally on the daemon's own tick and
/// never on session activity (see <see cref="HeartbeatWriter"/>), so a publisher with nothing
/// to say keeps beating and "quiet" can never be read as "gone".
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Not a session file.</b> The beat lives in a <c>heartbeats</c> directory beside

/// source of a publisher's name that survives a receiver holding none of its sessions. The
